DFS to solve sudoku - CodeCademy Project # 4

Basic Requirements
User Story: As a user I want to be able to input a valid starting sudoku board.

This can be done in pieces (one box/row/column at a time) or all at once.
User Store: As a user I want to be able to choose to use the most recent starting board.

Board can be hard-coded initially to help you get started, since the focal point of this project is the implementation of minimax. This will also streamline testing, as it wonâ€™t be necessary to manually input a board each you run the program.
User Story: As a user I want to be able to quit the program or go again after each cycle.

Additional Challenges
Intermediate Challenge

User Story: As a user I want to be able to switch between 4x4, 9x9 and 16x16 configurations.

Advanced Challenge

User Story: As a user I want the program to save the output, in addition to printing to console, so that it can be preserved and accessed separately.
